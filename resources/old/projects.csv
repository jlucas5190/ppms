This is very important: the Etrolizumab campaign is proposing to have 5 qualification runs - less than in the past product transfers to OCN.
Secondly, this tank will permit cleaning cycles to be tested during cleaning validation. And, such issues can contribute to the complexity of qualification runs. A thorough product license application has cleaning validation complete during the qualification runs.
It is anticipated the cost of the tank will enable saving in cleaning validation time & resource and will increase the effectiveness of the engineering runs.

This results in a potential loss of up to 6 runs per year (up to 15 runs every 3 years).
